# HACKMIT_2020 Good Neighbors Project

### 2020 has challenged us continuously and exposed us to tragedy upon tragedy. Covid-19 further distanced our communities, in which we may feel more out of touch than ever. We wanted to achieve two things, namely, bringing our communities together and showcasing the good in our communities amidst all the tragedies we keep hearing from. 

Idea: Create a forum where everyone in need of help due to the health crisis can post requests for aid. Requests can range from simple in person errands that immuno-compromised people cannot fulfill, to tech support or socially-distanced companionship. Other users can then log in the web app to view the requests and fulfill them, upon which they are awarded points. The point system is mainly used as an incentive in two ways. The first way involves a leaderboard of the regions with the most fulfilled requests or good actions, whereby we can showcase the good in our local communities, and the second involves a possible deal between local businesses and the application. Points could be redeemed at local businesses for vouchers, which could both incentivize good action and boost sales for local businesses. To further demonstrate the good happening all around us, the app could display recent stories of requests fulfilled nearby!

for reference:
- reading POSTs from front-end: can find relevant code in Backend/views.py
- controller methods: called in view.py, interface with "database", located in Backend/views.py
- front-end stuff: located in Backend/static, Backend/src, Backend/templates
- testing stuff: python run.py, then go to localhost:5k!
